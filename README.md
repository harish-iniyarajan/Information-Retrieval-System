# Information-Retrieval-System
Implemented LSA which uses SVD decomposition on the Cranfield dataset to retrieve documents relevant to user given query. This project was done as a course project for CS6370 - Natural Language Processing in IIT Madras.

## Instructions
- To use this code, clone it to your local machine and run the main.py file. You will be presented with an option to either give your custom query and fetch the top 10 relevant documents or to evaluate the IR system on the entire dataset.
- Make sure the directories are in the same order and necessary dataset is downloaded. Cranfield dataset is included with this repo. 
- To use a different dataset, replace Cranfield dataset with the desired dataset and change dataset name in the code. 
- After replacing the dataset, make sure to run the `trainSpellChecker()` function to generate a new train.txt relevant to the dataset.

The final report explains the theory behind the code.
